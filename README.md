## 🔰 Introduction

This project aims to develop a facial recognition-based attendance system to streamline student tracking in classrooms. By leveraging Machine Learning and MLOps practices, the system automates attendance, improving accuracy and operational efficiency. It provides a scalable, maintainable solution for educational institutions looking to replace traditional manual methods.

Manual attendance tracking in classrooms is time-consuming, error-prone, and susceptible to fraud. These issues are amplified in large-scale classes, where administrative tasks can hinder instructional time and classroom efficiency. Additionally, the lack of automation makes it difficult to scale or integrate with modern digital education infrastructures.

To address these challenges, the project proposes an end-to-end facial recognition attendance system. The solution integrates real-time video input with trained face recognition models for automated student identification and attendance logging. The system incorporates an MLOps pipeline, ensuring automation in data versioning, model training, continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD), monitoring, and retraining.

The main objective of this project is to automate the attendance process, saving time for both instructors and students. It aims to:
- Minimize errors and prevent cheating by using facial recognition instead of roll calls or sign-in sheets.
- Update and store attendance data in real-time, enabling easy tracking, reporting, and management.
- Enhance the professionalism and modernization of classroom management in educational institutions.

## 🖼️ Instructions

### 🧑‍💻 How to Use the Application

This section explains how the app work and interactions with the desktop attendance app:

1. **Startup Interface**:
   - When the application launches, it shows **3 buttons**:
     - `Take Attendance`
     - `Register New Face`
     - `Show Attendance List`

2. **Show Attendance List**:
   - When clicked, it opens a list displaying:
     - Student **Name**
     - **ID**
     - **Present status**
   - This button toggles to **Close Attendance List** when opened.

3. **Register New Face**:
   - Prompts the user to **input a video** of a new student following a required format.
   - The system will extract facial features and associate them with a student ID.

4. **Take Attendance**:
   - Starts the webcam for real-time recognition.
   - Three new buttons appear:
     - ✅ `Confirm` – confirms detected faces and updates the attendance list.
     - 🔁 `Retry Wrong Face` – allows students to input their **Student ID** if misclassified, then re-checks.
     - 🔙 `Back` – stops the camera and returns to the initial 3-button interface. The extra buttons (`Confirm`, `Retry`, `Back`) disappear.

5. **Flow Logic**:
   - After each confirmation, the `Take Attendance` process continues.
   - Exiting via `Back` will cleanly shut the camera and return to the main screen.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
This project uses **GitHub Actions** to: automatically retrain a machine learning model whenever new video data is uploaded. The process includes preprocessing video data, generating embeddings, and uploading both embeddings and the updated model to Weights & Biases (WandB).

Key Features:
- Fully automated retraining via GitHub Actions triggered by a repository_dispatch event from a backend system.
- Sequential execution of data segregation, training, and testing scripts.
- Secure WandB integration using GitHub Secrets.
- Resulting model artifacts (e.g., .pkl files) are logged and stored in WandB.

_Workflow file:_
```bash
.github/workflows/main.yml
```

## 🧭 Next Steps

### Short-Term Orientation

#### 1. Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS)
In the initial phase, the project will focus on integrating with popular LMS platforms such as Moodle or Google Classroom, enabling automatic synchronization of attendance data with the course management systems.

#### 2. Improving Facial Recognition Accuracy
The system will first be optimized to operate effectively under common classroom lighting conditions. The goal is to ensure accurate facial recognition in typical classroom scenarios.

#### 3. Supporting Attendance for a Single Class
Basic functionalities will be developed to support attendance for a single class. This includes facial recognition-based check-in, attendance list display, and storing attendance status.

#### 4. Developing a Mobile Interface
A mobile-friendly version of the application will be created so that students can mark their attendance using their smartphones, particularly suited for online or hybrid learning environments.

### Long-Term Orientation

#### 1. Expanding Support for Multiple Classes and Users
In the long term, the system will be extended to support multiple classes and different user roles, such as instructors, administrators, and students. This will allow the system to be used in large-scale or multi-campus institutions.

#### 2. Real-Time Attendance Data Analysis and Reporting
The system will include real-time data analysis and reporting features, allowing instructors and administrators to track attendance trends, identify students at risk of chronic absenteeism, and take timely action.

#### 3. Applying Machine Learning to Predict Student Behavior
Machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze attendance data and predict student engagement patterns, enabling personalized interventions to enhance learning outcomes.
